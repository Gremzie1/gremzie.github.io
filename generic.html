								<h2>Dear My Friends,</h2>
								<p>It is through you and because of you that I've been so lucky as to be able to put together stupid shit like this. I never imagined I would be in a position where no matter how bad of a day I have, I can come home
								and know I have people around me filled with love and support. I want to say thank you to each and every one of you who has ever decided that I was worth keeping around.<br> Let's make December 13th, my birthday, a night that is special to all of us.<br>Thank you so much,<br> Gremzie.</p>
